# Portfolio

I just wanted to create a portfolio and practice React at the same time.

Three different languages, two tones (formal and informal), and three themes: one raw default style reminiscent of the early internet, another one tailored for job searching, and a third designed for social media.

`npm install`
`npm run dev`

Or you can simply view it at https://www.sabatie.com.ar

If you want to see a specific theme:
