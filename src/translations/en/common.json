I overcame an illness, and after leaving the hospital, I stopped chasing material things. I chose to do what I love and let everything else follow as a result of my passion for living and learning.",
    "parrafo2": "I quit my job and started working with computers—a tough decision since I don’t live alone, but with my partner, and already had my first child (now I have two). I've always dreamed of working in something tech-related, and I'm turning that dream into reality. This site is part of that journey—a place where I’ll be sharing what I learn, experimenting with new ideas, and growing."

This excerpt would be a summary of my personal wiki."
